### Youtube

Ques:- How to develop youtube if interview ask how to explain all the stuff.

- 1. Requirement Clasification
     -- i. Features We need to discuss what features we are going to build in this application. You have to discuss with interviewer that what features you are going to build this is first step of requirement clarification.
     -- ii. Tech Stack :- We need to tell the interviewer what technology we are going to use in this application and why we will use it.
     I would choose tailwind with react to customize or style my application and I want to use redux to manage the data in whole application.

     ### Why you choosing redux?

     - I want to use redux for all the data management but you are going to small application context api make sense small application does not have any complex data flows or something. we can choose to use Context API but you are building an app like Youtube we should use redux.

     ### why you are choosing tailwind?

     - It is modern framework. It makes our React App very fastly. We can develop our application very fast with tailwind.

     You should have justification about why you are choosing every small damn thing.

     - if my application a lot of consists of forms we should use formic to manage form.
     - Now we need to discuss about routing i would be using React Router DOM for routing.
     - What bundler you are choosing? So we will say we are going to use parcel bundler
     - What testing library you are choosing? So we will say we are going to use jest, react testing library.
     - You can talk about the storage.
